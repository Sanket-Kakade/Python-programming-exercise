1. Create a 3X3 numpy array with random integers. Replace all odd items with 0.

2. Create 2 numpy arrays with shape 1X3 and 2X3. Create a new array c by stacking them vertically so that its shape should be 3X3

3. Create 2 numpy arrays of shape 1X10. Filled with random integers between 0 to 10. Create a new array with common elements between them. 

4. Create 2 numpy arrays of shape 1X10. Filled with random integers between 0 to 10. Create a new array mentioning the index of the common elements between those arrays. 

5. Create a 1-D array with 8 elements. Create a new array with the elements in the original arrays reversed. 

6. Create a 1-D array with 8 elements. Calculate the mean, median and std deviation of the elements in that array. 

7. Create a numpy array with shape mXn where m and n are user defined inputs, containing random integers between 0 to 30. Filter elements which are greater than 10 and divisible by 3.

8. Create a 1-D array with 20 elements, containing random integers between 0 to 15. Find the count of unique values in the array.

9. Create a 1-D array with 20 elements, containing random integers between 1 to 5. Convert the numbers to the text using following rule:
1: 'Very Bad'
2: 'Bad'
3: 'OK'
4: 'Good'
5: 'Very good'


10.Create an 8X3 integer array from a range between 10 to 34 such that the difference between each element is 1 and then Split the array into four equal-sized sub-arrays.
Eg:
Creating 8X3 array using numpy.arange
[[10 11 12]
 [13 14 15]
 [16 17 18]
 [19 20 21]
 [22 23 24]
 [25 26 27]
 [28 29 30]
 [31 32 33]]

Dividing 8X3 array into 4 sub array

[array([[10, 11, 12],[13, 14, 15]]), 
array([[16, 17, 18],[19, 20, 21]]), 
array([[22, 23, 24],[25, 26, 27]]), 
array([[28, 29, 30],[31, 32, 33]])]

11. Following is the input NumPy array delete column two and insert following new column in its place.

sampleArray = array([[34,43,73],[82,22,12],[53,94,66]]) 

newColumn = array([[10,10,10]])

Array after inserting the given column

[[34 10 73]
 [82 10 12]
 [53 10 66]]

12. Create a 5x5 matrix with values 1,2,3,4 just below the diagonal. 

13. Consider a (6,7,8) shape array, what is the index (x,y,z) of the 50th element? What is the index of 100th element?

14. Consider a random 10x2 matrix representing cartesian coordinates, convert them to polar coordinates.

15. Consider a one-dimensional array Z, build a two-dimensional array whose first row is (Z[0],Z[1],Z[2]) and each subsequent row is shifted by 1 (last row should be (Z[-3],Z[-2],Z[-1])

16. Create a numpy array of dimension (5X5) with integer values between 0 to 5. Find the most frequent value in the array.

17. Consider two arrays A and B of shape (8,3) and (2,2). How to find rows of A that contain elements of each row of B regardless of the order of the elements in B? 

18. Write a code using numpy function program to create random array of size 10 and replace the maximum value by -1.

19. Write a code using numpy to find the most frequent value in an array.

20. Create a 5X2 numpy array from a range between 100 to 200 such that the difference between each element is 10.

21. Create a numpy array with shape mXn where m and n are user defined input, containing random integers. Create an array of odd rows and even columns. 

Sample input:
m= 5
n= 4
Input array:
[[ 3  6  9 12]
 [15 18 21 24]
 [27 30 33 36]
 [39 42 45 48]
 [51 54 57 60]]

Output array:
[[ 6 12]
 [30 36]
 [54 60]]
