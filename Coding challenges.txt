1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 4 but are not a multiple of 7,
between 300 and 1000 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Sample o/p:
300,304,312,316 ......

2. Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hi, hello, sunday, monday
Then, the output should be:
hello, hi, monday, sunday

3. With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
6
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36}

4. Wtite a function which will accept a binary number and return the corresponding decimal number of it. Do not use python in-built function. 

Sample input: 1001
Output: 9

5. Accept a sentence from user and count the number of words and number of letters in the given sentence
Sample input: 'Hi how are you'
Sample output: Words- 4, letters- 11

6. Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Then, the output should be a list:
1,9,25,49,81

7. Write a Python program using nested for loops to construct the following pattern.

* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
*

8. Accept the year as an iput from the user and check if it is a leap year. If it is, print 'It is a leap year'. If not, print the number of year required for the next leap year. 

Sample input: 2004
O/p: It is a leap year 
Sample input 2: 1998
O/p: 2

9. Write a Python program which takes two digits m (row) and n (column) as input and generates a two-dimensional numpy array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Sample input:  m= 2, n= 3

Sample Output: [[1,2,3,]
		[2,4,6,]]

10. Accept a number from user and print its multiplication table. 

Sample input: 6
Sample output: 
6 x 1 = 6                                                               
6 x 2 = 12                                                              
6 x 3 = 18                                                              
6 x 4 = 24                                                              
6 x 5 = 30                                                              
6 x 6 = 36                                                              
6 x 7 = 42                                                              
6 x 8 = 48                                                              
6 x 9 = 54                                                              
6 x 10 = 60 


11. Write a program which accepts a list as an input and create a dictionary containing the unique elements of the list and their number of occurances. 

12. Write a code snippet which extracts the vowels out of the given string. 
Sample input- 'mumbai'
Output: 'ui'

13.Create an array of shape m*n where m and n are user accepted input. Fill the array with random elements with each number between 5 to 50. Create a new matrix by subtracting the mean of each row. 
Sample input: m=2, n=2
matrix: [[6,10],[15,40]]

Output: [[ -2, 2],[12.5, 12.5]]   

14. Create an array of shape m*n where m and n are user accepted input. Swap the first two rows of the array.

15. Creat a numpy array and extract perfect cubes from it.
